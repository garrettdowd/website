Low altitude airspace is predicted to be much more crowded and automated in the near future. Current aviation safety technologies, like ADS-B, are not built for such crowded environments and unmanned aircraft system (UAS) transportation management (UTM) systems are still being developed and tested.</p><p>I worked with the State of Ohio to develop cooperative autonomy concepts for one of the first UTM systems to be implemented on a major U.S. corridor. This project is part of <a href="https://uas.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/uas/initiatives/flyohio-initiative" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FlyOhio</a> and is housed under <a href="https://drive.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/driveohio/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DriveOhio</a> and the <a href="https://uas.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/uas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ohio UAS Center</a>. The views expressed in this article are my own.</p><p>This article will review</p><ol><li>Current state of low-altitude, automated flight commercialization</li><li>Current research on communication and collaboration</li><li>Building an autonomous and connected flight platform</li></ol><h2>State of the Drones</h2><p><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Support for autonomous drone delivery is developing quickly. Last month, Amazon obtained further approval to operate as a Standard Operator under </span><a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/advanced_operations/package_delivery_drone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">FAA Part 135</a><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">, which enables its drones to carry commercial payloads on beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) flights. UPS Flight Forward and [Google] Wing Aviation already attained Standard Operator certification under Part 135 certification last year. </span></p><p>Zipline is the most well-known company in the drone delivery space. It has been delivering medical supplies in Rwanda since 2016 and has now made over 50,000 commercial deliveries. Walmart recently announced a partnership with Zipline to trial deliveries in the U.S. (Arkansas). Operating in the U.S. is more difficult for many reasons including pervasive airspace restrictions, larger numbers of unscheduled aircraft operations (Part 135), and manned flight that does not require pilot certification (paramotors/ultralights).</p><p>Because low-altitude airspace is becoming more crowded and automated, there are many efforts to provide new solutions that will enable safe operation. One such effort is focused on creating an "air traffic control" for drones. UAS Transportation Management (UTM) systems are aimed at enabling safe operation of low altitude, autonomous vehicles, similar and complimentary to the FAA's Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems. UTM is currently a joint effort between NASA, FAA, and private industry. The concept of UTM is divided into technical capability levels (TCL) that are similar in concept to self driving car automation levels. TCL 4 is the highest level that involves UAS operation in dense urban environments.</p><p>FlyOhio is currently a UTM TCL 3 project that is focused on enabling detect and avoid abilities. My work was focused along the U.S. Route 33 corridor near Columbus, Ohio. The project was <a href="https://uas.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/uas/initiatives/other-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">investigating the potential of passive radar and communication</a> to create a highly automated corridor for both ground and air traffic.</p><h2>Aerial Autonomy Research</h2><p>Many drone delivery companies are focusing on the introverted aspects of autonomy. Vehicle design, flight control, and navigation are all at the top of the R&amp;D list. The government is focusing on UTM and supporting technologies/standards. One such effort is to find an alternative to Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) that works for low-altitude environments that have higher vehicle densities (generally less than swarm densities).</p><p>ADS-B is a communication standard that automatically broadcasts an aircraft's location, heading, speed, and other relevant information. It is similar to the Basic Safety Message defined in SAE J2735 for automotive use.  ADS-B is required on all aircraft in designated airspace as of January 1, 2020 according to Federal Regulations <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8137158693744ba666e318c1f474d81b&amp;node=se14.2.91_1225&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">14 CFR 91.225</a> and <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8137158693744ba666e318c1f474d81b&amp;node=se14.2.91_1227&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">14 CFR 91.227</a>. ADS-B radios operate at 978 MHz (Universal Access Transceiver) for general aircraft and 1098 MHz (Extended Squitter) for high-performance aircraft however, the communication is neither encrypted nor authenticated posing possible security risks. Furthermore, a <a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2017-1154" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2017 study</a> stated that ADS-B will not be able to support the future density of low altitude flight expected with delivery drones and air taxis. A <a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2018-3200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2018 study by the NASA Langely Research Center</a> used this research to suggest the use of dedicated short range communication (DSRC) instead of ADS-B for low altitude flight. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) is also <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8735159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">investigating the use of DSRC in low altitude airspace</a>. </p><p>DSRC is a set of communication and hardware standards for ground transportation use. <a href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/autonomous-vehicles-will-fail-without-this-technology/">I wrote an article about DSRC and the important of communication for self-driving cars</a>, which offers great context for the following discussion.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">If DSRC technology becomes standardized for both ground and air traffic then there is a unique opportunity for collaborative autonomy between self-driving cars and drones.</p><h2>Building an Autonomous DSRC Flight Platform</h2><p>[Un]Surprisingly, there is little research on the topic of collaborative/cooperative autonomy between drones and self-driving cars. It was my job as the FlyOhio project lead for the Automated Driving Lab to both conceptualize use cases and design research to explore this idea. I led a number of theoretical, <a href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/simulating-autonomous-vehicles/">simulation-based</a>, and applied research efforts. This section will focus on the autonomous flight platform that I built to research the use of DSRC as a communication link between ground and air vehicles.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/uavagv.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/uavagv-xs.png 384w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/uavagv-sm.png 600w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/uavagv-md.png 768w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/uavagv-lg.png 1200w" alt=""></figure><h3>Objective</h3><p>Build an aircraft that can carry DSRC equipment, communicate with an autonomous ground vehicle, and make onboard guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) decisions based on communication received via RC, telematics, and DSRC communication links.</p><h3>Payload</h3><p>In many ways, the payload specification is the most impact decision is the design of an aircraft. A payload difference of 50 grams vs 500 grams is the difference between a toy aircraft and an aircraft that can cause serious physical harm. I used automotive grade DSRC equipment which had a total weight of 600 grams. However, to accommodate future research objectives and equipment the payload capacity was set at 4 kilograms, a payload common for mid-range professional drones.</p><h3>Power/Thrust</h3><p>To achieve flight the vertical thrust of the vehicle must be greater than the opposing force from gravity (the gross weight) for the vehicle to accelerate upwards and achieve flight, Newton's Second Law.<br><br>The gross weight during flight, or takeoff weight, includes both the payload and the vehicle weight. The vehicle weight obviously depends on the components chosen including motors, batteries, and airframe. However, motor, wing, and battery selection depend on the gross vehicle weight. Therefore, designing the power systems of a UAV involves solving implicit, nonlinear equations and thus is usually an iterative process.<br><br>One common method to reduce the dimensions of the design space of a multi-rotor UAV is to define a Thrust to Weight Ratio (TWR). The TWR is an indication of how responsive or controllable a vehicle will be. A common TWR for multi-rotors is 2:1, e.g. a five kilogram vehicle would require ten kilograms of thrust. A 2:1 TWR would give a maximum vertical acceleration of 1G (9.81 m/s^2) which is more than sufficient for most applications. </p><p>Knowing the payload and the TWR reduces the thrust design domain to an equation only involving the vehicle empty weight. For a 4 kilogram payload it was found through motor/propeller/battery/airframe iteration that the total thrust would need to be near 19 kilograms.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/prop-2.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/prop-2-xs.png 384w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/prop-2-sm.png 600w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/prop-2-md.png 768w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/prop-2-lg.png 1200w" alt="" width="380" height="253"><figcaption>Watch your fingers around these 17" carbon fiber propellers</figcaption></figure><h3>Air-frame</h3><p>One of the main trade-offs in air-frame selection is efficiency (flight time) vs stability/failure robustness. Generally, larger motors and propellers will be more efficient. However, having a larger number of smaller motors can lead to increased controllability and better failure tolerance. This trade-off will determine the type of airframe configuration. Common multi-rotor configurations include quadrotors, hexarotors, and octorotors. A hexarotor frame from Tarot was chosen because it offered enough space to add additional components. </p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/IMG_6186.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_6186-xs.jpg 384w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_6186-sm.jpg 600w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_6186-md.jpg 768w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_6186-lg.jpg 1200w" alt="" width="356" height="475"></figure><h3>Battery</h3><p>The last main design decision is the battery chemistry and capacity. There is generally more flexibility in battery capacity choice based on desired flight times and dynamic performance (TWR). In many cases, different battery capacities could be used depending on the flight mission.</p><p>Lithium-polymer (Li-Po) batteries are a popular choice because they have some of the highest power densities (power/mass and power/volume). Due to the large power requirements, a 6S (22.2V) power system was chosen. It can be difficult/expensive to source battery packs above 6S and there are fewer consumer motor/ESC choices that are compatible with voltages above 6S. </p><p>Discharge rating is also an important battery parameter, but in the consumer market these ratings can be misleading or false because there are no standard testing methods or certification bodies. It is best to assume a discharge rate of 10-20C.</p><p>There is a bit more to consider when designing a Li-Po based power system. It is important to understand how Li-Po battery voltage varies based on its state of charge and load (discharge rate). It is also important to understand internal resistance and how it changes over time based on the characteristics of charge/discharge cycles. However, let's stay on topic and move on to the most important/relevant component choice.</p><h3>Flight Controller</h3><p>Because this aircraft is being designed as a research platform, it needs to be highly customizable. The Pixhawk 4 is an open-source flight controller that has complete software customizability. It also has relatively good hardware/conectivity capabilities. External processing units can be added for camera or RaDAR assisted flight control which enable obstacle avoidance and more precise lateral and longitudinal control. For the initial configuration, a GPS unit, RC transceiver, and telematics radio was added. This initial setup enables automated flight, but with limited obstacle avoidance capabilities.</p><p>Most importantly, the Pixhawk 4 offers a CAN (controller area network) connection that makes it easier to interface with the WSU5900 DSRC radio provided by DENSO.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/uavcomp.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/uavcomp-xs.png 384w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/uavcomp-sm.png 600w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/uavcomp-md.png 768w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/uavcomp-lg.png 1200w" alt="" width="420" height="336"></figure><h3>Integrating DSRC</h3><p>As seen below, the DSRC radio was attached to the bottom of the hexacopter airframe. This gives the DSRC antennas a clear view of the ground below. Sourcing linearly polarized antennas for the correct frequency range, in the correct form factor, with the correct [automotive] connectors was not an easy task. </p><p>The DSRC wiring harness offered a CAN interface that could be connected to the Pixhawk 4 via a custom connector. A J1939 DBC file allows the Pixhawk 4 to decode the CAN messages from the WSU5900.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/uavdsrc.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/uavdsrc-xs.png 384w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/uavdsrc-sm.png 600w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/uavdsrc-md.png 768w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/29/responsive/uavdsrc-lg.png 1200w" alt="" width="276" height="414"></figure><p> </p><h2>Characterizing DSRC Link Parameters</h2><p>In theory, the ability for ground and air vehicles to communicate via DSRC is highly dependent on antenna choice (polarization, radiation pattern, diversity), radio power, and signal processing (multi-path, beam-forming, etc). While much of this can be calculated via the Friss equation or high fidelity simulations, it can still be useful to measure real-world performance.</p><p>This can be fairly drab and boring to delve into, so I am going to leave some plots below for any of the technically inclined that are interested.
