So new that we created a new name for it, flex pricing. I was the lead product manager and founder of Glyde and this is a quick story about it.</p><h2> </h2><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Dynamic pricing.</strong></span><strong> 😬</strong></h2><p>If you are already familiar with dynamic pricing then you can skip the next section. If not, don't worry. I removed any differential equations and confusing economic notation.</p><p>What thoughts does "dynamic pricing" bring to mind? Uber surge pricing? Airline tickets? Dynamic pricing has a fairly negative connotation. However, in the age of big data and free capitalism, it is lauded as a technique the promises max yield and utilization of assets. The largest ticketing company for travel is Amadeus, a company worth 40 billion USD in 2018. Originally founded by major European airlines, it now owns the majority of the airline ticketing business and is a prominent purveyor of dynamic pricing.</p><p>There are countless guides on the internet describing how to fight back against dynamic pricing systems. While Amadeus does not publish what data their algorithms use, it is probable they use a combination of personal and system information. <a href="https://amadeus.com/en/portfolio/airlines/dynamic-pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Their dynamic pricing website </a>states, <em>"Analyze flight offers that customers have previously seen and bought, in order to model future shopping behavior and calculate passengers’ willingness to pay - in real-time. Offer the right price for a shopping session and hit the optimal 'sweet spot' between raising the price to make more money per seat and lowering the price to increase the probability of the customer picking your offer." </em>In industry speak, this is called optimizing <strong>loading</strong> and <strong>yield</strong>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Loading</span> is a measure of asset utilization (a.k.a. Are there empty seats?) and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">yield</span> is a measure of revenue or profitability per customer. Balancing loading and yield to maximize total revenue is the name of the game and roughly <strong>"loading * yield = total revenue</strong>". I'm sorry if you weren't expecting a deep dive on dynamic pricing, but we need to go one step deeper.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dynamic-pricing.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="519" height="260"></figure><p>The reality is that loading and yield are somewhat inversely related. Higher ticket prices means that fewer people are willing to purchase a ticket at that price and vice versa. This is commonly referred to as <strong>price sensitivity</strong>. A good example of price insensitive customers are business travelers, who have travel requirements regardless of price. The challenge of dynamic pricing is to charge price insensitive customers a premium price (increase yield) while still attracting price sensitive customers with a discount price (increase loading). Traditional dynamic pricing tries to predict a customer's price sensitivity and overall market demand to set a unique ticket price for each [potential] customer. That's it. It's a simple economic idea that is quite complex at scale.</p><p>The reality is that these algorithms often use personal data that is either collected from web interactions or purchased from third parties to make price sensitivity predictions. Furthermore, I think there are valid ethical concerns of applying dynamic pricing techniques to essential services such as transportation. For example, do you think traditional dynamic pricing should be used in healthcare? So what is the alternative?...</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">How do you set prices and ensure public assets or essential services, like a rail network, are being efficiently used by the public? </p><p> </p><h2>Glyde.</h2><p>As we learned in the last section, dynamic pricing is a technique to increase total revenue by optimizing <em>loading</em> and <em>yield</em>. At the heart of dynamic pricing is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>price sensitivity</em></span><strong>, </strong>which is what dynamic pricing algorithms try to predict.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">But what if there was a mechanism that <em>removed the need to predict price sensitivity</em>? <em><strong>What if a customer would willingly divulge their price sensitivity</strong></em>... to their ultimate benefit? This is the question at the core of Glyde.</p><h3> </h3><h3>In The Beginning 🚆</h3><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" style="outline: 3px solid rgba(var(--primary-color-rgb), 0.55)  !important;" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/Annotation-2020-07-10-213739.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/responsive/Annotation-2020-07-10-213739-xs.png 384w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/responsive/Annotation-2020-07-10-213739-sm.png 600w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/responsive/Annotation-2020-07-10-213739-md.png 768w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/responsive/Annotation-2020-07-10-213739-lg.png 1200w" alt="" width="449" height="122"></figure><p>Glyde was born as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Flexrail</strong></span> from Hacktrain 3.0, the premier rail industry hackathon in Europe and possibly the best overall hackathon... ever. Hacktrain 3.0 was a 48-hour marathon that took place on moving trains across Europe with stops across 9 different venues. <a href="https://www.silverrailtech.com/hacktrain-an-inside-persepective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is a written account of the event</a> from they folks at SilverRail. Or better yet, watch the official video below.</p><figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f8AxokvfcX0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><p>If the video didn't already spoil it, Flexrail placed first in the competition. I was the team lead and pitched the product at the finals.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/IMG_7562.JPG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_7562-xs.JPG 384w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_7562-sm.JPG 600w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_7562-md.JPG 768w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/responsive/IMG_7562-lg.JPG 1200w" alt="" width="518" height="291"></figure><p>Hacktrain was not the only success. I won additional entrepreneurial awards and competitions including UCL Bright Ideas and FFactor. FFactor allowed me to pitch Flexrail at the lauded Founder's Forum in front of founders, CEOs and even Prince Harry and David Cameron. Founder's Forum is also where I met Bibop Gresta, Founder and Chairman of HyperloopTT, but that is saved for another post.</p><h3> </h3><h3>The Flex Ticket 🍰</h3><p class="msg msg--success">So why did Flexrail win so many awards?</p><p>Let's start with the Flex Ticket. The Flex Ticket enables customers to trade travel flexibility for discounted tickets. Ultimately, this allows rail operators to offer discounted tickets targeted at price sensitive customers with little risk of losing yield on price insensitive customers.</p><p>Let's compare the Flex Ticket experience to a traditional ticketing experience provided by Trainline, a leading rail ticketing platform in the UK.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/Trainline-Pricing.gif" alt="Traditional Booking Experience" width="241" height="429"><figcaption>Traditional Booking Experience</figcaption></figure><p>The traditional ticketing experience shows a large number of ticket options to travel between London and Manchester. Users must scroll through all the listing to find the cheapest ticket that matches their travel requirements. The same tickets are also shown to every customer so traditional pricing techniques are employed to charge higher prices for services that are predicted to be more heavily used or of higher value.</p><p class="msg msg--warning"><em>Note: There are many nuances to the way ticket prices are set, which is the result of a complex relationship between the government that owns to the infrastructure and the rail franchises that operate services on the network. More on this later</em></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/Flexrail-Pricing.gif" alt="Flexrail Booking Experience" width="243" height="431"><figcaption>Flexrail Booking Experience</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike traditional ticketing, the Flex Ticket experience is a two step process.</p><ol><li>The user picks a Travel Window (time window during which they are willing to travel) in advance of their travel date/time and are given an immediate price. This makes the flexibility/price trade-off completely transparent. They are issued a Flex Ticket which is a promise for a ticket during their selected Travel Window.</li><li>Closer to the travel date/time, the user is issued a ticket for a specific train/time within their Time Window. Exactly when the user is issued a specific train/time depends on the rail operators pricing strategy.</li></ol><p>So the main concept of a Flex Ticket is that customers are trading the certainty of their travel time for a price discount. This notion fits fairly well with existing economic theory. The more interesting insight is that the most price sensitive customer select the largest Travel Window. </p><p class="msg msg--success">Price sensitivity = Flexibility = Time = $<span class="LrzXr kno-fv">£</span>‎€</p><p>Better yet, there is a near perfect linear correlation between price sensitivity and travel flexibility confirmed by over 150 user interviews. This is the roux of the secret sauce that powered Flexrail's algorithms.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/Annotation-2020-07-13-133336.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/responsive/Annotation-2020-07-13-133336-xs.png 384w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/responsive/Annotation-2020-07-13-133336-sm.png 600w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/responsive/Annotation-2020-07-13-133336-md.png 768w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/responsive/Annotation-2020-07-13-133336-lg.png 1200w" alt="" width="456" height="390"></figure><p>But Wait. There's More.</p><p> </p><h4>Dynamic Load Factor Smoothing (DLFS)</h4><p>The Flex Ticket mechanism allowed Flexrail to optimize the loading of high frequency services. </p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/Annotation-2020-07-13-143126.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/responsive/Annotation-2020-07-13-143126-xs.png 384w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/responsive/Annotation-2020-07-13-143126-sm.png 600w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/responsive/Annotation-2020-07-13-143126-md.png 768w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/5/responsive/Annotation-2020-07-13-143126-lg.png 1200w" alt=""></figure><p>Using historical and real-time ticketing data I built a prediction model to estimate future loading over an arbitrary time-span. This allowed Flexrail's algorithms to assign Flex Ticket holders to trains predicted to be less full. It is important to note that the predictions have accuracy limitations and only Flex Tickets can be optimally assigned. This means that DLFS will not solve problems like <em>peak loading</em> for certain commuter routes. However, there are industries other than transportation where DLFS is much more useful such as theme parks.</p><p> </p><h3>Why Flexrail Ultimately Failed</h3><p>Rail markets are complex and slow moving monoliths. Unlike rail markets in countries where the entire rail system is nationalized, the UK rail market is partially privatized. The government, Network Rail, owns the infrastructure but does not operate any services. Private companies compete for "franchises" to operate a defined service or route. The franchises are defined with extreme detail and give private companies little flexibility to deviate from the franchise contract.</p><p>In fact, the amount of money that a private company makes from a rail franchise is stipulated in the contract. Any extra profit the franchise makes must be given back to the government. Ticket types and prices are also regulated by the government to varying degrees. </p><p>These factors combined with the personal challenges of living abroad in London led to the eventual spin-down of the Flexrail business efforts.</p><p>However, this was the beginning of Glyde, a pivot away from the rail industry. A pivot that allowed me to work around the world with some amazing people.
