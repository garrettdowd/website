However, a glass of water did not solve my food growing problems. So, I designed and built an automated, apartment-sized, aquaponic grow system that I released as an open-source project on Github. For the motivation behind this project check out my article, <a href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/why-food-sucks/">Why Food Sucks</a>.</p><p>This is the first article in a series about the uFarm product design process.

It attempts to solve real user problems/pains in a way that tackles <a href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/why-food-sucks/">systemic problems with the food system</a>. In many ways it is a low cost experiment to assess the viability of a social startup.</p><p>The organic movement is a good example of what uFarm is trying to achieve. Without the work of film makers and non-profits, consumers would have no reason to choose organic produce at the shop or eat at a farm to table restaurant. While the organic movement has become overly commercialized, it has at least moved the public to be more conscious of what they eat.</p><div class="post__toc"><h3>Table of Contents</h3><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1eh0v94l53hj">Social Impact Disclaimer</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1eh0v94l53hk">Product</a><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1eh0v94l53hl">Problems</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1eh0v94l63hm">Users</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1eh0v94l63hn">Business Environment</a><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1eh7uv3djft">Competition</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1eh7uv3djfu">Technology Trends</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1eh7uv3djfv">Regulatory</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1eh0v94l63hr">Product Specs</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1eh0v94l63ho">Trade-offs</a><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1eh7q4ekdf6">Aquaponic vs Nutrient Dosing</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1eh7q4ekdf7">Size</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1eh7q4ekdf8">Automation</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1eh7q4ekdf9">Customizability vs Simplicity</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="mcetoc_1eh0v94l53hk">Product</h2><p>What problems does uFarm solve? Who is it for? How is it strategically positioned? What features should be built first? These are all part of the product vision that inform engineering design choices. While uFarm is an experimental side project that is not meant to be commercialized, it is meant to have value. Product and user focused thinking helped me to test more valuable hypotheses with the initial uFarm prototype.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1eh0v94l53hl">Problems</h3><p>Taking startup methods cues from Steve Blank and Eric Ries, uFarm is based on a number of hypotheses about the problem, user, and solution. In my opinion, startups in the personal food growing space often fail because they do not identify painful problems. Rather, they create new problems including maintenance and living space clutter. uFarm is focused on common problems that are shared by anyone who cooks food at home.</p><ol><li><strong>Food spoilage</strong><ol><li>A surprising amount of food waste occurs because food portions sold at groceries are too large or because you didn't get around to making that basil pesto as soon as you had hoped. This is especially true for people that do not live with a partner or family.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Time</strong><ol><li>It is taco night, how often have you forgotten the cilantro/corriander and had to take a quick run to the shop. Or, more realistically, you have taco supplies at home and there is no way that you are venturing outside of your house to buy fresh produce.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Cannot purchase at grocer</strong><ol><li>For culinary enthusiasts it can be hard to find ethnic or regional varieties of herbs. Kaffir lime, curry leaves, holy/thai basil, birdseye chilis, and even lemongrass can be hard to find. Because these herbs are less popular they sit on shelves for longer periods and quickly loose their flavor and/or spoil before they make it into your mouth.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Sustainability and production transparency</strong><ol><li>What you choose to eat has a large impact on the environment and people's lives. At the end of the day, certifications and labels like USDA Organic or Free-Trade Certified are ultimately stacks of paperwork that the consumer can neither view nor verify.</li></ol></li></ol><p>At a societal level there are additional problems. A quick overview of these problems were given from a system perspective in my article, <a href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/why-food-sucks/">Why Food Sucks</a>. However, I want to reframe these problems with a user perspective.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/21/The-Uncooked-Chicken0672925011499429947.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/21/responsive/The-Uncooked-Chicken0672925011499429947-xs.jpg 384w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/21/responsive/The-Uncooked-Chicken0672925011499429947-sm.jpg 600w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/21/responsive/The-Uncooked-Chicken0672925011499429947-md.jpg 768w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/21/responsive/The-Uncooked-Chicken0672925011499429947-lg.jpg 1200w" alt="" width="450" height="292"></figure><ul><li><strong>Cooking is hard</strong><br><ul><li>Not everyone is a Ferran Adria or a Nathan Myhrvold.

If the product is socially important then everyone should use it right? While widespread adoption may be the goal for the greatest social impact, product success does not grow on trees. Again taking cues from the tech startup world, Geoffrey Moore and his book Crossing the Chasm offer a commonly used framework to think about user categories and market adoption. This section will focus on</p><ol><li>Innovators</li><li>Early Adopters</li></ol><p>The ideal <strong>innovator</strong> is both a tech and plant geek. There aren't many of us. We have a broad understanding of electronics/computers and love to build rather than talk. Each of us are interesting in plants for different reasons. Some of us found a love for plants through food, some of us grew up working in gardens or on farms, and some just want to grow plants on spaceships for interstellar journeys. The innovator has an account on Github and uses it to try out projects that other people have created. The innovator is not worried about blowing a fuse or fixing a leak.</p><p>The <strong>early adopter</strong> is not as technically literate. However, what they lack in technical skill they make up for in passion for fixing our food system. They are careful about what food they buy and who they buy it from. They attend their local farmers market and they probably have a small garden at home. They may subscribe to food philosophies such as veganism, but they understand that these philosophies are about principles and not about rules. They are looking to do more, but time is a limiting factor.</p><hr><h3 id="mcetoc_1eh0v94l63hn">Business Environment</h3><h4 id="mcetoc_1eh7uv3djft">Competition</h4><p>uFarm is not the first automated home grow system. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/grove-ecosystem/grove-ecosystem-grow-fresh-food-in-your-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grove Ecosystem</a> is a failed startup that raised over $4M USD from high profiles investors like Tim Ferris in 2016. Grove struggled with manufacturing and seemed to fail at attracting early adopters. There are many smaller countertop aquaponic systems like <a href="https://ecobloom.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EcoGarden</a> and <a href="https://www.aquasprouts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aquasprouts</a>, however these are extremely small and simple solutions that are more of a display piece than a useful tool. There are also automated grow boxes that rely on nutrient dosing such as <a href="https://www.grobo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grobo</a>, <a href="https://www.seedolab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seedo</a>, and <a href="https://www.getleaf.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leaf</a>. Most of the automated hydroponic systems focus on growing cannabis, which seems to be one of the only profitable target markets at the moment.</p><p>There are very few open-source hydroponic projects.
