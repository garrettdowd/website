We still use Facebook even though we know it is designed to be addictive. Heck, I even got you to click on this article based on a "clickbait" title and an image often used for MEMEs.</p><p>There, of course, is a raging debate over how how much control we can exert over our lives. Psychology has uncovered a lot of vulnerabilities in our reasoning and decision making. So let me ask a surprising question;</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">Is distracted driving really our fault? Can we be blamed for driving distracted?</p><p>The obvious answer is <strong><a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/campaign/distracted-driving" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">yes</a></strong>. Driving and using your phone at the same time is the single most idiotic thing you can do in a car besides <strong>D</strong>riving while <strong>U</strong>nder the <strong>I</strong>nfluence of a drug. It shows that you do not value the health and well-being of the people around you. However, most people do care about the well-being of their friends and even strangers around them, so what gives?</p><p>Let's say you were asked to push a button for a piece of your favorite candy, but at the slight chance that your friend sitting across from you will lose their arm, would you do it? Probably not. The trade-off is clear and direct. A piece of candy is not worth injuring your friend.</p><p>The trade-off is not clear and direct for distracted driving. We feel that we are in control and we think we are competent. Changing the song on Spotify or replying to a message at a stop light does not seem like that big of a risk. The reality is much more grim.</p><h2>Stop It!</h2><p>Ok, so maybe you already knew that we humans are stupid. Maybe you already understand the inherent problems. But the problem still exists right? Maybe you still can't resist the urge sometimes?</p><p>There have been so many failed solutions created by tech companies and automotive manufacturers. Steering wheel hand sensors, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, gaze tracking, and driving modes that silence phone notifications have all mostly failed to solve the fundamental problem. </p><p>Why? Because the tech and auto companies are totally missing the fundamental problem, the root cause, the principal instigator! The real problem is...</p><p><strong>Automatic Transmissions</strong></p><p>Yes, you read that correctly. Let me underline it for you.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Automatic Transmissions</strong></span></p><h2>The Solution!!!</h2><p>That's why I designed the all new, and completely novel.... Manual Transmission!!!</p><p>This breakthrough in engineering uses bleeding edge principles from cognitive science and complex systems to design the ultimate, human-in-the-loop, anti-distracted driving control system!</p><p class="msg msg--info">Yes, you have reached the crux of this article. I am sorry to disappoint you. But if you want to understand the (non-comedic) nuances in my argument then keep reading.</p><p>I started driving a manual transmission car about two years ago now. A beautiful silver 2002 Acura RSX with a 5-speed gearbox. You know what I also stopped doing about two years ago? Driving Distracted.</p><p>When it matters most (urban environments, stop and go traffic) manual transmission vehicles require <strong>two hands and two feet</strong> to drive. Not only is your body physically engaged, your central nervous system also has to coordinate all of that action!</p><p>No longer can you stomp on the accelerator when it is time to go. You have to disengage the clutch, shift into first gear, release the brake, and then simultaneously engage the clutch and apply the accelerator. This added time helps you to become more aware of your surrounding after disengagement with your phone. Genius!</p><p>Manual transmissions are the ultimate redundant, anti-distracted driving, safety feature! What could be better?</p><ul><li><strong>Manual transmissions are cheaper than automatic transmissions</strong></li></ul><p>Wow, no way!! BUT WAIT,</p><p>There's MORE!!!</p><ul><li><strong>Manual transmission are more efficient that automatic transmissions</strong> (weight savings and power transfer)</li></ul><p>YES, you get TWO for <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the price of one!!!</span> the incredible price of NO MORE DISTRACTED DRIVING.</p><h2>The Conspiracy</h2><p>Ok, but really. How is this possible? How did we go from a manual transmission that is cheaper, more efficient, and prevents distracted driving to an automatic transmission that basically <span style="text-decoration: underline;">kills people and the environment.</span></p><p><strong>Automatic transmissions are designed by The Devil. </strong></p><p>Lucifer is an amazing engineer. Not only is he proficient in Solidworks and ANSYS, he also keeps a focus on business strategy. Let's count the number of ways that automatic transmissions (AT) accomplish the Devil's business goals.</p><ol><li>Murder<ol><li>As already mentioned, ATs enable distracted driving which causes <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/campaign/distracted-driving" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">injury and death</a>.</li><li>ATs are less efficient, causing more environmental pollution and killing vulnerable populations</li></ol></li><li>Lust<ol><li>ATs only require one hand, giving you a free hand for other activities.</li></ol></li><li>Gluttony<br><ol><li>Road nuggets, doughnut holes, etc. Excessive eating on long trips is now within reach!</li></ol></li><li>Sloth<ol><li>By definition, ATs are targeted at users that have a "disinclination to exertion"</li></ol></li><li>Theft<ol><li>Cars with ATs are easier to steal. No knowledge of how to use a clutch needed!</li></ol></li></ol><p>Is anymore proof needed?!?</p><p>It is time to say NO to the Devil and replace your automatic transmission car with a new and improved manual transmission car! <a href="http://chng.it/KgVdxbYS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Call now!</a></p><h2>The End</h2><p><a href="http://chng.it/KgVdxbYS">Sign this petition to Ban Automatic Transmissions</a>!</p><p>Now on to more serious notes. While I had a lot of fun spinning this ridiculous parable-like article, I think I need to frame these thoughts in concise language.</p><ol><li>Distracted driving is a <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/campaign/distracted-driving" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">serious problem</a>! We all know it and have done it ourselves.</li><li>We are not as smart as we think we are. We need to design systems and products ahead of time with this in mind.</li><li>The solution to problems is not always more technology.</li><li>Easier is not always better.</li></ol><p>You can sign a number of pledges to not drive distracted, but the best steps you can take are </p><ul><li>Enable your phone's "Driving Mode" that will automatically detect when you are driving and silence notifications.</li><li>Enable your phone's Do Not Disturb mode while driving.</li><li>Pull over in a safe place <span style="text-decoration: underline;">off the road</span>. Stop lights are the most common place for pedestrians and cyclists to be killed or injured!</li><li>Know your directions ahead of time. Do not adjust your phone's mapping/gps while driving.</li><li>No text is that important. Remember, everyone who crashes thinks that they can text without crashing.</li><li>Song choice is not that important, unless you want to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/coffin-dance-dancing-pallbearers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">become a MEME</a>.</li></ul><p>And don't forget to hold your friends and family accountable.</p></div><footer><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 9, 2020</p><div class="post__tags-share"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/t/transportation/">Transportation</a></li></ul><aside class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]"><svg width="32" height="32"><use xlink:href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.garrettdowd.com%2Fsolution-for-distracted-driving%2F&amp;title=The%20Most%20Cost%20Effective%20Solution%20for%20Distracted%20Driving" class="js-share linkedin" title="[MISSING TRANSLATION] LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> LinkedIn</a></div></aside></div></footer></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__top"><a class="logo footer__logo" href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/"><img src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/website/Garrett-Dowd-SF-2-01-svg.svg" alt="Garrett Dowd"></a></div><div class="footer__bottom"><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2020 Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Publii Static CMS</a></div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/garrett.dowd/" aria-label="Instagram" class="instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/garrettdowd/" aria-label="LinkedIn" class="linkedin"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></div></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop"><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/js/infinite-scroll.pkgd.min.js?v=4dd9a5c6d0be090b107ed878587f0039"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ea30e966488ea4e09df508f547988da0"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
