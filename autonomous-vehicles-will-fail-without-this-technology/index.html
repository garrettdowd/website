In fact, almost every example of complex networks in nature rely on this one thing that self-driving cars can not do...</p><p><strong>Communicate.</strong></p><p>If you are from the transport industry or work on autonomous vehicles you may be rolling your eyes at the moment. Communication in transportation has been on the development board for a LONG time. The U.S. government reserved spectrum in the 5.9GHz frequency range for vehicular use back in 1999 (<a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-99-305A1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FCC 99-305</a>)!!! Even with developed standards like IEEE 802.11p and SAE J2735 and a proposed mandate of DSRC radios from USDOT in 2016, communication has failed to make a significant impact in transportation for reasons beyond the scope of this article.</p><p>However, in the last ten years machine learning and improved computing power has led to huge leaps in autonomous vehicle development. According to some estimates, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/gauging-investment-in-self-driving-cars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than eighty billion dollars</a> has been dedicated to the pursuit of self-driving cars. With so much to loose and even more to gain, the autonomous vehicle industry is highly competitive and that is reflected in every company's technology strategy.Â </p><p>Self-driving cars are poised to greatly benefit from vehicular communication, but most companies intend to commercialize (or are currently commercializing) them without communication capabilities, vehicular or human.</p><h2>Why communication is important.</h2><p>Bio-mimicry has been one of the most interesting areas of scientific study and engineering design in the past decade. In machine learning, neural networks are based on the understanding of how human brains work and have led to immense gains in the practicality and use of machine learning techniques. Without neural networks, self-driving cars as we know them today would not exist.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2015/01/16/istock_000041703624large_wide-61304d12b42f1c346b2344039f6c2f294692699e.jpg?s=1400" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="534" height="300"></figure><p>Bio-mimicry has also made its way into other engineering domains such as control systems and traffic management. Researchers have studied everything from bee foraging methods to ant colony traffic to design autonomous intersection management and cooperative cruise control (platoon) algorithms. These algorithms fundamentally rely on inter-vehicle communication. This is less sci-fi fantasy and more of an everyday occurrence than you might think.</p><p>Four-way stops? Pedestrian crossings? The reality is that we use more than just our brake lights and indicators to signal our intent. Autonomous vehicle companies have recognized this for a long time and modified vehicle controls to more closely mimic human driving behaviors. However, this method of communication or "language" is neither standardized nor inherently safe.</p><p>Ask the U.S. Federal Aviation Agency or any other international aviation agency about the importance of clear and precise communication. Even in the wide open space above our heads, communication (ADS-B and voice) is necessary to ensure safety.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight"><strong>In other words, aviation industry investments in communication have led to measurable safety improvements.</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://img.militaryaerospace.com/files/base/ebm/mae/image/2020/05/16x9/ATC_market_11_May_2020.5eb5484d57cb1.png?auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;w=1200" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="551" height="310"></figure><p>There is a plethora of evidence from both nature and other transportation industries that communication is a key component to safety and optimization. However, communication has yet to find its place in ground transportation.</p><h2>Challenges</h2><p>As mentioned in the introduction, there has been little progress in ground transportation communication given the 20+ year history of the industry. The current state of the U.S. industry is raveled in indecision. If we want to unlock the full potential of communication for ground transportation we need to tackle some big challenges.</p><p>When ITS and DSRC concepts were developed in the 1990's and 2000's, autonomous vehicles were a gutter dream. Cars were human driven AND owned. While DSRC could have improved overall public safety, there was little market incentive for vehicle manufacturers to justify R&amp;D costs. The government stepped in (as it should have) to fund research, technology, and standards. Even with government support, market incentive did not develop.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2020 and autonomous vehicles completely change the paradigm.</p><ol><li>AVs rely on data from sensors<ol><li>AVs rely on a multitude of sensors that are error-prone in certain circumstances. LiDARs do not like snow and rain, cameras hate glare from direct sunlight. Each sensor has a failure mode, so a range of sensor types helps to reduce the number of complete failure modes. Communication offers information rich data that can supplement existing sensors (blind corners, vehicles trajectories, etc).</li></ol></li><li>AVs are expected to be company owned/operated<ol><li>Safety will no longer be sold on a sticker (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Car_Assessment_Program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see NCAP</a>), so AV developers and transportation providers will be required to maintain incredibly high safety standards. There is clear economic motivation to invest in technology that measurably improves safety (rather than measures of safety that sell cars).</li></ol></li></ol><p>So why are AV companies not devoting resources to communication efforts?Â </p><h3>Egg or Chicken</h3><p>Language is only useful if other people understand it. So how do you start a language? Similarly, a two-sided market like Uber is only useful if there are both drivers and riders. Two-sided markets rely on network effects, which are now a core principle in many digital businesses. While there may be a company using network effects to build an "Airbnb for pets", no one has fully solved the two-sided market style challenges for V2X.</p><p>However, a crack is developing. Telematics is already an important/standard part of autonomous vehicles system for monitoring and dispatch. Cellular V2X standards are in the process of being developed that would make V2X integration a negligible cost. The question is, how do you bring the other side of the market to the table? Human driven cars are not disappearing anytime too soon. Cities are becoming more pedestrian centric. Road work will continue to be an entire season in Michigan.Â </p><h3>Security</h3><p>As with any cyber-physical system, malicious hacking could cause serious physical destruction. The good news is that communication security is a long studied field with great tools and processes; thank you world wide internet! The bad news is that there are still security challenges for decentralized, wireless, real-time communication networks.</p><p>There may always be some vulnerability that we are willing to accept; e.g. interfering with GPS systems it relatively easy, but doing so will land you in federal prison for a long time. In any case, success of ground transport communication is inherently linked with improvements in security.</p><h3>Technology</h3><p>There is currently a silent battle taking place between DSRC (ITS-G5/IEEE 802.11p) and C-V2X (3GPP). DSRC is the incumbent technology that has been backed by government for more than a decade. C-V2X is a relatively new addition created by the mobile communication industry. C-V2X defines new/different physical and medium access control (MAC) layers. Qualcomm, a major manufacturer of wireless chips, describes C-V2X as having "increased communication range (~2X), better non-line-of-sight (NLOS) performance, enhanced reliability, and cost efficiency" when compared to DSRC. However, it is not that simple. <a href="increased communication range (~2X), better non-line-of-sight (NLOS) performance, enhanced reliability, and cost efficiency" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A recent paper published in the 2019 IEEE VTC</a> shows that C-V2X under-performs DSRC in high vehicular density (urban) environments. There are pros and cons for both standards and the industry seems to be leaning towards a hybrid system. The reality is that technology adoption may depend on which use-case/implementation gains traction first.</p><p>Â </p><h2>Finding the Opportunity</h2><p>Thanks for making it to this point in the article. There is a lot of opportunity waiting to be unlocked by self driving cars and vehicle communication technologies. However, it is difficult to make concrete assessments of this opportunity without the proper tools.</p><p>Traffic simulation is a powerful tool that gives traffic engineers and urban planners a way to assess the potential impact of traffic pattern and infrastructure changes. However, there is no great way to simulate generalized connected vehicle use cases.</p><p>This is why I created a <a href="https://github.com/garrettdowd/py_ptv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python library for PTV Vissim</a>, a leading traffic simulator, that makes it easier for researchers and engineers to simulate connected and automated vehicle use cases.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="file://C:/Users/me/Documents/Publii/sites/garrett-dowd/input/media/posts/10/pyptv.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="file://C:/Users/me/Documents/Publii/sites/garrett-dowd/input/media/posts/10/responsive/pyptv-xs.png 384w, file://C:/Users/me/Documents/Publii/sites/garrett-dowd/input/media/posts/10/responsive/pyptv-sm.png 600w, file://C:/Users/me/Documents/Publii/sites/garrett-dowd/input/media/posts/10/responsive/pyptv-md.png 768w, file://C:/Users/me/Documents/Publii/sites/garrett-dowd/input/media/posts/10/responsive/pyptv-lg.png 1200w" alt="" width="444" height="232"></figure><p>Learn more about simulating connected and autonomous vehicles in my next article.
