Back then, more than half of Americans were living in rural farming communities. These farmers grew a variety of crops and raised a variety of animals. Preservation techniques like fermentation, drying, and smoking were still common and had been passed between generations over thousands of years.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/9/farm-family-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/9/responsive/farm-family-2-xs.jpg 384w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/9/responsive/farm-family-2-sm.jpg 600w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/9/responsive/farm-family-2-md.jpg 768w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/9/responsive/farm-family-2-lg.jpg 1200w" alt="" width="323" height="259"></figure><p>I never got to meet my great grandparents. I did not grow up plucking carrots from a field. I did not chase a chicken for dinner. I grew up eating fried lumps of ground chicken trimmings that were neatly packaged in a cardboard container and served with a side of flavored corn syrup sauce.</p><p>There is growing criticism of the current industrialized food system. Chronic disease and ecological destruction follow in the wake of so called "market demands". Popular social opinion often points to one of many causes including overpopulation, food waste, or unchecked capitalism. The reality is more complicated.</p><p>However, a number of visionaries are currently rethinking what our food system needs to look like in the next 20 years to meet population, health, and lifestyle demands. From vertical and shipping container farming to suburban permaculture oases, there are a number of efforts to re-balance the food system for the health of humans and the environment.</p><p class="msg msg--success">Hyper-local food production is a potential solution to many of the problems the plague our food system.</p><p>Over the past year I have designed, engineered, and tested a personal food growing device for urban dwellers. I think this grow system should be available to everyone which is why I have <a href="https://github.com/garrettdowd/ufarm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-sourced the design on Github</a>.

What problems have been created by agricultural industrialization and how does hyper-local food production attempt to solve them?</p><h2>Consolidation of Agriculture</h2><p>How many farmers do you know today? How many different sub species or cultivars of bananas have you eaten?</p><p>Over the last century, industrialization has pushed the majority of food production into the hands of fewer and fewer farms which produce fewer and fewer varieties of plants and animals. According to <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/farming-and-farm-income/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statistics from the USDA</a>, the number of farms in the U.S. has decreased from approximately seven million in 1935 to approximately two million today.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/Charts/58267/farms_fig01_9_2018_350px.png?v=5829.1" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="350" height="279"></figure><p>There are still two million farms, which is more than you might expect. However, the centralization of production volume is another story. Ninety percent of farms only account for twenty percent of production. Large scale farms make up only three percent of farms, but account for forty-six percent of total production value.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/Charts/90817/farms_fig03Nov2019_350px.png?v=5829.1" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="350" height="279"></figure><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yet, farms are not where the majority of power consolidation has occurred.</span> The alarming consolidation is in seed production where a handful of chemical and pharmaceutical corporations control the market for many crops. Corporations like Dow, DuPont, and Bayer (acquired Monsanto) sell seeds because they can (and do) make killer profits from selling pesticides and other complimentary chemical products. <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=42531" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The USDA published a report in 2004</a> that details this consolidation. Similar analysis can be drawn for livestock production.</p><p>The main point is that U.S. agriculture has consolidated to the point of concern, in my opinion. However, there is obviously more sides to the story. With consolidation comes optimization and the optimization is quite impressive.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/Charts/58283/farms_fig02_350px.png?v=2131.8" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="350" height="279"></figure><p class="msg msg--info">From an engineering perspective, industrial agriculture is an absolute marvel of modern process design, mechanization, and logistics.</p><p>Hundreds of millions of people are being fed with a minimal amount of human time and effort. People can now spend more of their time on entertainment, relaxation, or investigating some of life's most interesting questions. Johns Hopkins has a great <a href="http://www.foodsystemprimer.org/food-production/industrialization-of-agriculture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overview the industrialization of food production</a> and it effects including distribution and waste.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" style="font-size: 18.4px; outline: 3px solid rgba(var(--primary-color-rgb), 0.55)  !important;" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/9/soy-tractor-400x300.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/9/responsive/soy-tractor-400x300-xs.jpg 384w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/9/responsive/soy-tractor-400x300-sm.jpg 600w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/9/responsive/soy-tractor-400x300-md.jpg 768w, https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/9/responsive/soy-tractor-400x300-lg.jpg 1200w" alt="" width="355" height="266"></figure><div><div style="text-align: center;"> </div><h2>Why Food Sucks</h2><p>Again from a system and engineering point of view, food production is a process to be optimized to increase profit. This has led to plants/animals that are cultivated and engineered for</p><ul><li>high yield</li><li>mechanized harvest</li><li>transportation</li><li>selling (tangible appearance and shelf life)</li></ul><p>While not inherently bad, these optimization variables have unintended consequences that result from incomplete scientific understanding and misaligned economic incentives.

References will be added at the end of this articles as my time allows. The main point is that</p><p class="msg msg--warning">Food is at the heart of many modern crises including chronic disease and environmental destruction. Systemic changes to food production and consumption are needed.</p><h2>How to Make Food Not Suck</h2><p>The good news is that we are in the middle of an agricultural revolution. There are startups working on a huge range of ideas;</p><ul><li>creating meat/protein alternatives</li><li>using crops for carbon capture and storage</li><li>reducing chemical use by surveying with drone and satellite imagery</li><li>creating more efficient food marketplaces</li></ul><p><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Some of these efforts seek to make the current system work better while others are on a quest of systemic disruption. One such systemic disrupter is the growing field of hydroponics and the business model of hyper-local produce production. Hydroponics, also known in the U.S. as soilless culture, is enabling food producers to grow food closer to where it is consumed, all while using less resources and pesticides.</span></p></div><div> </div><div>In part two of this series, <a href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/the-future-of-food-is-hyper-local/">The Future of Food is Hyper-local</a> | A Promising Vision for the Future of Agriculture, I delve into the proposed benefits of hyper-local food production and the science behind it.</div><div> </div><div><a href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/the-future-of-food-is-hyper-local/" class="btn">Part 2</a></div><div> </div><div>Updates:</div><div>02/09/2020 - Added USDA statistics and resources on agricultural consolidation</div><div> </div></div><footer><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 2, 2020</p><div class="post__tags-share"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/t/food/">Food</a></li></ul><aside class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]"><svg width="32" height="32"><use xlink:href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.garrettdowd.com%2Fwhy-food-sucks%2F&amp;title=Why%20Food%20Sucks" class="js-share linkedin" title="[MISSING TRANSLATION] LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> LinkedIn</a></div></aside></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><div class="wrapper wrapper--narrow"><h3 class="h5">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--fixed"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><figure class="c-card__image"><img src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/posts/19/vertical-farming.webp" loading="lazy" height="616" width="863" alt=""></figure><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/the-future-of-food-is-hyper-local/">The Future of Food is Hyper-local</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"><a href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/t/food/" class="c-card__tag">Food</a> <time datetime="2020-08-19T14:40">August 19, 2020</time></footer></div></div></article></div></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__top"><a class="logo footer__logo" href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/"><img src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/website/Garrett-Dowd-SF-2-01-svg.svg" alt="Garrett Dowd"></a></div><div class="footer__bottom"><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2020 Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Publii Static CMS</a></div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/garrett.dowd/" aria-label="Instagram" class="instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/garrettdowd/" aria-label="LinkedIn" class="linkedin"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></div></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop"><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/js/infinite-scroll.pkgd.min.js?v=4dd9a5c6d0be090b107ed878587f0039"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ea30e966488ea4e09df508f547988da0"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
