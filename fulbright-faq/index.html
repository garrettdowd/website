Were they receptive/helpful?</h3><p>I contacted the program director during the summer of my application. Letters of affiliation for degree programs were still suggested when I applied. They were very receptive and helpful and that can be expected from most faculty and programs that you would contact about the Fulbright. I had limited contact with the faculty compared to those who applied for research awards.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ef3d7n9836a">Do you know who I would contact about country specific questions?</h3><p>First make sure to review the country specific information on the website, for example <a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries/selectedcountry/united-kingdom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here is the country page for the UK</a>. Next, check if the country has a Fulbright commission. Most commissions will have a website or some web presence. Again, for example <a href="http://www.fulbright.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here is the UK Commission website</a>. Depending on your question you can also</p><ol><li><a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact IIE</a></li><li>Contact the commisson/embassy, <a href="http://www.fulbright.org.uk/about-us/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK Commission contact info</a></li><li><a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org/alumni/alumni-ambassadors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find a Fulbright Alumni Ambassador</a> or other alum from the relevant country</li></ol><h3 id="mcetoc_1ef3d7n9836b">What were the most challenging or unexpected aspects of your Fulbright experience?</h3><p>Everyone's unexpected challenges are quite different. Everything from severe sickness to housing problems. Living in London, most of my unexpected challenges had to do with housing.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ef3d7n9836c">How did you craft a compelling Statement of Grant Purpose for a degree program without falling into traps such as repeating what was listed on the university’s website?</h3><p><a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org/application-components/academic" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://us.fulbrightonline.org/application-components/academic&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596749896681000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHrwpVmD7Rky--Oje_IR4c6SX_6ug" rel="noopener">The website</a> gives great info and lists the question at hand, "What are your reasons for selecting a particular institution?". To answer this question you should first speak to your current career trajectory/interests and then directly relate them to facts about the program you are applying to. For example, "I am studying the acute response of chimpanzees when they are shown pictures of cute golden retriever puppies. The program at France University has the most cute golden retriever puppies in the world and would further my research and professional development."</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ef3d7n9836d">Did you explore any distinctions in your field between the U.S. and the U.K.? Why did  you feel the U.K. was the right place for you to study?</h3><p>For my application, cultural differences were not front in center when drawing contrast between the program I was applying for and everything else out there. I made my case around the specific structure/benefits of the degree program I was applying for, which was structured quite differently than other MBA degrees, and offered clear alignment with my goals.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ef3d7n9836e">How did you incorporate your international experience in your application?</h3><p>Integrating your previous international experience is very important. If you feel that your international experience ties in nicely with your "pitch" in the SOGP then put it there. Put less ambiguously, if your international experience is related to your academic/reserach topic or you gained knowledge that will be useful in your studies/research then include it in the SOGP. This will strengthen the (This is what I am interested in - This is what I have accomplished so far - This is why Fulbright is the best opportunity to further my career goals) pitch.</p><p>If your international experience is not directly related to the topic/theme of your SOGP then put it in the personal statement. The reality is that living abroad is no small feat. Many times the degree program is the least of your worries. The selection committee wants to ensure that all grantees will last the duration of the grant and it can be useful to discuss how you handled any difficulties while living abroad. </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ef3d7n9836f">Do I need a letter of affiliation? How do I get one?</h3><p>Definitely visit the official website and look at the specific grant information. This may vary by country and Award. However, the information below might be accurate for most study grants in the UK.</p><ol start="1" type="1"><li>A letter of affiliation can be either a letter of admission or a letter of acceptance. Both can be accepted for review with the application, as an applicant can submit up to three letters of affiliation. If an applicant does not have a letter of admission, but wishes to add a letter from a department or professor specifically supporting their project they can add that.</li><li>You are correct, admission to a university is required for final receipt of the Fulbright award. A letter of admission is not required at the time of application, but can be accepted, and must be presented in order to receive the award.</li><li>A letter of affiliation is not needed, however, both a letter of affiliation or admittance does strengthen an applicant’s application.</li><li>All letters of affiliation or admittance are reviewed by the National Screening Committees if they are received prior to October 8<sup>th</sup>. Further, if a candidate is moved on to semi-finalist status, any letters submitted with their application as well as any received in the interim can be reviewed by the UK Commission. Any letters can strengthen an applicant’s application, but there is no disadvantage for not having one either.</li></ol><p>How do you get one? Many times this involves reaching out directly to faculty or program directors via emails found on the university website.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ef3d7n9836g">One of my largest concerns is feeling like I am not good enough for the program and it is making writing my application difficult. What was your process for writing your application and what did you highlight that made you a stand out. </h3><div> </div><div>I appreciate your honesty and directness. Trust me you are not alone. Even those who receive a Fulbright wonder how they got it.</div><div> </div><div>Focus on what you are passionate about and build a story around it. For example, I began with a little story about the small "businesses" I started as a kid (lemonade/crafts/lawncare) and how that tied into what I wanted to do with my career....and more importantly why the Fulbright was the best opportunity to achieve those career goals. Passion, competency, and a bit of blissful ignorance about the competition can make a great start to an application.</div><div> </div><div>Be prepared to revise your application A LOT. I revised my application countless times with a <a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org/fulbright-program-advisers" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://us.fulbrightonline.org/fulbright-program-advisers&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596749895805000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFLK8qrtILhkrd_aNSUHi0isfd9tw" rel="noopener">Fulbright Program Advisor</a> (may want to check in with your undergrad university, unless you are applying "at-large"). I also did not get the Fulbright the first time I applied for it. I know a few others have the same story.</div><div> </div><div>Definitely check out some of the <a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org/resources/recorded-webinars" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://us.fulbrightonline.org/resources/recorded-webinars&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596749895805000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEE4zvvI-YtDz8oKh5uxn30A72q3g" rel="noopener">Fulbright webinars</a> on application content. They often have Fulbright alumni talk about their applications.</div><h3 id="mcetoc_1ef3d7n9836h">Have you encountered any positives or negatives about pursuing and receiving a Master's degree abroad, as opposed to staying within the U.S.? </h3><p>Outside of Oxford and Cambridge (and maybe London School of Economics), I have found that there is very little name recognition for other globally ranked universities across the American business world (the opposite is true for the academic world). Ultimately, there is immense value in getting a Master's degree abroad from a well ranked university. Given the opportunity to redo everything, I would quickly pick the Fulbright and UCL degree over a Harvard MBA any day.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ef3d7n9836i">Did you talk about specific courses or professors that interested you within the program? </h3><p>Yes! Including this can help you to answer the question - [Why do you need to do this research/degree in this country at this university?] The MSc. Entrepreneurship at UCL is quite special because it essentially acts as a talent incubator. The program is set up to help students start and grow scalable companies, which was a core proposal in my SOGP. This is quite different from how MIT or Harvard structure their MBA programs. So, it offered a clear reason why UCL was one of the best, if not the best place, to pursue my goals.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ef3d7n9836j">Did you specify in your Statement of Grant Purpose your intended dissertation on public transportation, or was that something you developed while studying at UCL?</h3><p>Great question. I actually proposed another project in my SOGP focused on building a decentralized, crowd-sourced emergency response service. However, my focus changed to the rail industry quite quickly once I started classes and assessed my opportunities. For an MSc. in Entrepreneurship this is somewhat normal (to pivot). However, for more technical degrees it is more uncommon to drastically deviate from your SOGP proposal.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ef3d7n9836k">In what ways did London add or detract from your experience at UCL? </h3><p>I think London is one of the best cities to get an MBA or any other graduate business degree. The access to people, companies, and money is unrivaled by most other cities in the world. A major downside of living in London is cost. I practiced frugality the majority of my time while Fulbright peers in other UK cities (and other countries) were not as concerned on budgeting based on my personal experience.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1efkjrb1u1q">For Host Country Engagement, did you focus on ways to get involved within the UCL campus or with London in general? In what ways did you end up engaging with the community? </h3><p>There are two main points that need to be made in the Host Country Engagement response.</p><ol><li>How will you act as an ambassador outside of your research/studies?</li><li>How will you develop a support structure to cope with difficult circumstances?</li></ol><p>From my experience, I think some of the best strategies rely on engaging through your passions/interests whether that is sport, music, art, food, etc. That could take the form of being involved with UCL or University of London student groups, however it could also take almost any other form. London is special because the opportunities are seemingly endless and a community can be found for even the most esoteric interests.</p><p>Again, I think the MSc. Entrepreneurship is a bit different because of the networking requirements of the program itself. I spent what felt like a majority of my time meeting with local entrepreneurs, engineers, designers, and investors. I also participated in hackathons and coding challenges. I think I originally proposed getting involved in a football club and volunteering at a local community kitchen, but my schedule prevented me from doing either of those things.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1efkjrb1u1r">Any other tips or tricks?</h3><ol><li>Start early (6-7 months).</li><li>Revise, revise, revise!</li><li>Stay strong even when success seems unlikely.</li></ol><p>I did not start the application process with extremely concrete and succinct ideas of why I wanted to pursue a Fulbright Award. While I was fortunate to intern abroad at engineering companies in Seoul and Bangalore, I spent much of my undergraduate career with my nose in an engineering textbook or prepping for an exam. I did not take enough time to really think about and plan my 5/10 years goals. The application process really helped me to slow down and carefully think about myself and my goals, which really required months of time to solidify.</p><p>I did not get the Fulbright Award the first time I applied because I bombed the UK Commission interview. However, by that point I already convinced myself that the Fulbright-UCL Award really was the perfect opportunity. I applied again, gained better insight into the interview, and was fortunate to receive the award the second time.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ef3dcr3036m">General Thoughts</h3><ol><li>Describing the distinctions in your field between the U.S. and U.K. shows competence and effort. If you can describe, as you just did, why  Kent is the best place to achieve your career goals (or follow your interests) then this will greatly enhance the strength of the application.</li><li>Being able to succinctly describe your field of interest to a group of laypeople while still maintaining the interest of experts is key. Your application will undergo at least two levels of review; the first by a selection committee that will most likely be familiar with your field and the second by the U.K. commission that will not be familiar with your field. If you can keep the reader's interest/respect then you can tie it in with your career goals and make them excited about the impact you could have in the world given the Fulbright.</li><li>Being able to succinctly describe your field and interests also reflects on your communication capabilities, which in turn reflects on your ability to be a good cultural ambassador. For example, while in the UK you may find yourself trying to explain race inequality, firearms, politics, and police brutality more often than expected.</li></ol><p> </p></div><footer><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 13, 2020</p><div class="post__tags-share"><aside class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]"><svg width="32" height="32"><use xlink:href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.garrettdowd.com%2Ffulbright-faq%2F&amp;via=%40iamgarrettdowd&amp;text=FAQ%20%7C%20United%20Kingdom%20Fulbright" class="js-share twitter" title="[MISSING TRANSLATION] Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> Twitter </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.garrettdowd.com%2Ffulbright-faq%2F&amp;title=FAQ%20%7C%20United%20Kingdom%20Fulbright" class="js-share linkedin" title="[MISSING TRANSLATION] LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> LinkedIn</a></div></aside></div></footer></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__top"><a class="logo footer__logo" href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/"><img src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/media/website/Garrett-Dowd-SF-2-01-svg.svg" alt="Garrett Dowd"></a></div><div class="footer__bottom"><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2020 Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Publii Static CMS</a></div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/garrett.dowd/" aria-label="Instagram" class="instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/garrettdowd/" aria-label="LinkedIn" class="linkedin"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></div></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop"><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/js/infinite-scroll.pkgd.min.js?v=4dd9a5c6d0be090b107ed878587f0039"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.garrettdowd.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ea30e966488ea4e09df508f547988da0"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
